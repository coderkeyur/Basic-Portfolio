                            Welcome to my first HTML project. here are few things about me. I work as a nurse anesthetist, where i give anesthesia to patients during surgery. usually in my free time I enjoy traveling, learning new skills, and trying out different kinds of food. I am an avid traveler and love photography. Lately I have been trying to learn photography and improve my picture taking skills. I love to explore national parks in the states. I have been to quite a few national parks in America, but my most favorite park is Zion in Utah. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also love technology and have been trying to learn coding for last few years. I think that once you know programming, you have blank canvas in form of computer screen and you can put your imaginations to work. Hence, I am here to learn these skills and hoping that one day i will be able to build something meaningful to this world. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Cheers!! This first project was somewhat struggle to complete. Hoping things will get easier next time around. Fingers crossed!
