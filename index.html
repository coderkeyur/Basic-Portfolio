            <p>
                I am an avid traveler and love photography. Lately I have been trying to learn photography and improve my shots. I love to explore national parks in the states. I have been to quite a few national parks, but my most favorite park is Zion in Utah. 
            </p>
                I also love technology and have been trying to learn coding for last few years. I think that once you know programming, you have blank canvas in form of computer screen and you can put your imaginations to work. Hence, I am here to learn these skills and hoping that one day i will be able to build something meaningful to this world.
